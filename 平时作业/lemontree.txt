Do you remember？
We snuck out
Stealing lemons from the neighbour's house
Wrapped up with you
In the hazy breeze
It's not the way it seems
Taste of your lips I can't resist
Sweet talkin' with the sour kiss
I don't know what you did to me
Maybe it's the summer dream, maybe
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
Where the lemontrees grow
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
With the lemontrees
Do you remember？
Down at the beach
We were riding ponies with the sandy feet
I tried to kiss you
Then you turn your cheek
It's not the way it seems, no no
Taste of your lips I can't resist
Sweet talkin' with the sour kiss
I don't know what you did to me
Maybe it's the summer dream, maybe
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
Where the lemontrees grow
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
With the lemontrees
(To the lemontrees)
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
Where the lemontrees grow
If we get caught
I know where we can go
Back to the fields
Where the lemontrees grow
